Hi! Welcome to my Coffee Ordering Game
This was a project I used to practice Decorator and Wrapper functions and classes in my Java class. Feel free to add on to it if you like!

HOW TO PLAY:
1. You can either press "New Order" or just begin clicking toppings right away
2. All toppings are on the left hand side. You can add however many of each you like
3. To remove an item, select the item in the list and then press "Remove item".
4. Once the drink order is complete, you can select "Add Drink to Order" (if you just want your coffee black, this can be your second step :) ).
5. Finally, select "Complete Order". A summary of all drinks as well as the grand total will be displayed at the bottom. Press "New Order" if you would like to do it again!
It is best to be viewed in full screen. You can add as many drinks as you like and make sure to select add to drink order after each drink is finalized!
Thanks for reading and happy ordering :)
